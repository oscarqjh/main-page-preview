> **Video-MMMU asks a fundamental question:**
> If a model 'goes to class,' can the model learn from the lecture and apply what it learned to MMMU-style exam problems?

## 🎯 Motivation

Our original goal was to build a **video reasoning benchmark**, motivated by the observation that the most demanding forms of reasoning arise in **academic settings**—for example, MMMU-style university exam questions.

**Online lectures** create an ideal environment for evaluating video reasoning. They effectively convey knowledge and naturally test a model's ability to learn from video. These videos have three key attributes:

1. **High information density** (heavy OCR/ASR signals)
2. **Advanced knowledge requirements** (college-level knowledge)
3. **Temporal structure** (concepts unfolding over time)

These properties make reasoning from lecture video notably harder. This leads to our core question:

**When a model watches an online lecture, can it learn like a student—understand the content, acquire the knowledge, and then solve related problems?**

Therefore, we introduce **Video-MMMU**, a video reasoning benchmark that evaluates **knowledge acquisition from video**.

## 📚 Overview

We introduce **Video-MMMU**, a multi-modal, multi-disciplinary, multi-track benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively large multimodal models (LMMs) **acquire knowledge** from educational videos.

### 1) Video: Knowledge Source

Traditional VideoQA benchmarks focus on scene understanding. **Video-MMMU treats video as a source of knowledge**, evaluating whether LMMs can actually _learn_ from instructional content.

**Dataset Composition:**

- **300 college-level, lecture-style videos**
- **30 subjects across 6 disciplines:** Art, Business, Science, Medicine, Humanities, and Engineering
- **High-quality educational content** from university-level courses

### 2) QA Design: Three Stages of Knowledge Acquisition

Each video is paired with **three questions**, designed to reflect a progression in knowledge acquisition:

- **🔍 Perception** – Identifying relevant surface information
- **🧠 Comprehension** – Understanding underlying concepts or strategies
- **🎯 Adaptation** – Applying learned knowledge to new scenarios

/>

### 3) In-Context Knowledge Acquisition: Learning Like Humans

**Humans consistently learn from the world around them.** For models to operate effectively in real-world environments, the same principle should apply: they must be able to learn from the world, because unlike humans, they cannot be endlessly re-trained after deployment.

In this sense, **videos provide a natural proxy for the world**. For a model, the video becomes its world. The ability to learn from video therefore becomes more than a technical benchmark—it is a measure of **true, dynamic intelligence**. It marks the shift from simply solving a task to demonstrating the ability to **learn how to solve the task**.

### 4) Metric: From Absolute Accuracy to Learning Efficiency (Δknowledge)

A core innovation in Video-MMMU is its shift from measuring only final performance to **measuring learning**.

#### Δknowledge Formula

<CodeDemo title="" showCopy={false}>
```
Δknowledge = (Acc_after_video - Acc_before_video) / (100% - Acc_before_video) × 100%
```
</CodeDemo>

#### Evaluation Process

**1. Initial Test:**
The model attempts to answer a question _without_ seeing the video.

**2. Re-Test after video viewing:**
We provide the corresponding lecture video. The model is asked the same question again.

**3. Performance Gain:**
If the model succeeds after watching, it demonstrates successful knowledge acquisition from video.

This setup mirrors a human's natural educational process:

<CodeDemo title="" showCopy={false}>
```
Don't know → Learn by watching → Apply the knowledge
```
</CodeDemo>

## 🔍 Key Insights

  alt="Performance Analysis"
  maxWidth="100%"
  caption="Figure 4: Comprehensive analysis showing progressive performance decline and the human-model gap in knowledge acquisition from videos."
/>

### **Progressive Performance Decline**

Model performance decreases as cognitive demands increase. While models perform relatively better on _Perception_ tasks, accuracy drops on _Comprehension_ and declines further on _Adaptation_.

### **Knowledge Acquisition Challenge**

The Δknowledge metric reveals a **significant human–model gap**:

- **Humans:** Substantial improvement (Δknowledge ≈ **33.1%**)
- **Top Models:** Smaller gains (GPT-4o: **15.6%**, Claude-3.5-Sonnet: **11.4%**)

This highlights a current limitation: **LMMs still struggle to learn from videos** in the way humans do.
