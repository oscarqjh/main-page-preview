## Overview

**LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-RL** presents an RL post-training stage utilizing 67K curated examples with discrepancy-based selection to generate explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving significant performance gains on STEM, coding, and reasoning benchmarks while maintaining visual understanding capabilities.

Our contributions are threefold:

**(1) Discrepancy-Driven Data Curation.**
We identify tasks where model performance gap exists between Pass@N and Pass@1 metrics, targeting "latent capability" rather than knowledge injection.

**(2) Rule-Based Reward System.**
We employ domain-specific verification rules rather than learned preference models, enabling precise feedback across STEM, grounding, spatial reasoning, counting, coding, OCR, and diagram tasks.

**(3) Two-Stage Curriculum Training.**
We design a training curriculum that first stabilizes concise task performance with answer-only RL, then unlocks deeper reasoning through chain-of-thought RL.

## RL Data Strategy

### Discrepancy-Driven Selection

We identify tasks where model performance gap exists between Pass@N and Pass@1 metrics. This approach targets "latent capability" rather than knowledge injection, ensuring the model learns to better utilize its existing knowledge.

### Reward-Based Sampling

Multiple candidate responses are filtered by average reward scores to exclude trivial and unsolvable cases, focusing on medium-difficulty instances that provide optimal learning signals.

---

## Reward System Architecture

We employ a rule-based paradigm with domain-specific verification rules rather than learned preference models:

| Category | Source | Reward Design |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| STEM | ViRL39K | Choice accuracy & math expression equivalence |
| Grounding | Ref-L4, VigoRL-SA | IoU between predicted/reference boxes; choice accuracy |
| Spatial | VigoRL-SAT | Choice accuracy |
| Counting | PixmoCount | Numeric token equivalence |
| Coding | WebCode2M, UniSVG | Token/tag overlap; SVG rendering similarity [0,1] |
| OCR | InfoVQA | Text similarity |
| Diagram | AI2D | Choice accuracy |

---

## Two-Stage Training Procedure

Training uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within the AReaL asynchronous framework:

### Stage 1: Answer-only RL

Normal split training with instruction *"Put ONLY your final answer within `<answer></answer>`."* This stage stabilizes concise task performance.

### Stage 2: Chain-of-Thought RL

Long-reasoning data with instruction *"Think and solve... within `<think></think>`..."* This stage unlocks deeper reasoning capabilities. A small proportion of normal-set examples are interspersed to prevent forgetting perception skills.

**Spatial & Grounding:** RL "fast mode" significantly enhances fine-grained perception on SAT and Ref-L4 benchmarks.

**Coding:** "Thinking" mode achieves highest scores on Design2Code and UniSVG, demonstrating chain-of-thought benefits for structural code generation.

## Development Roadmap

This release represents **Stage 3** in a multi-phase project:

| Stage | Focus | Data Scale |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Stage 1 & 1.5 | Pre-training & Mid-training | 85M multimodal samples |
| Stage 2 | Visual instruction tuning (SFT) | 22M instruction-following samples |
| **Stage 3 (Current)** | **RL post-training with GRPO** | **67K curated samples** |
