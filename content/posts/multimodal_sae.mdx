## Overview

For the **first time in the multimodal domain**, we demonstrate that features learned by **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)** in a smaller Large Multimodal Model (LMM) can be effectively interpreted by a larger LMM. Our work introduces the use of SAEs to analyze the open-semantic features of LMMs, providing a breakthrough solution for feature interpretation across various model scales.

## Inspiration and Motivation

This research is inspired by **Anthropic's remarkable work** on applying SAEs to interpret features in large-scale language models. In multimodal models, we discovered intriguing features that:

- **Correlate with diverse semantics** across visual and textual modalities
- **Can be leveraged to steer model behavior** for precise control
- **Enable deeper understanding** of LMM functionality and decision-making

## Technical Approach

### SAE Training Pipeline

The **Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)** is trained using a targeted approach:

1. **Integration Strategy** - SAE integrated into a specific layer of the model
2. **Frozen Architecture** - All other model components remain frozen during training
3. **Training Data** - Utilizes LLaVA-NeXT dataset for comprehensive multimodal coverage
4. **Feature Learning** - Learns sparse, interpretable representations of multimodal features

### Auto-Explanation Pipeline

Our novel **auto-explanation pipeline** analyzes visual features through:

- **Activation Region Analysis** - Identifies where features activate in visual inputs
- **Semantic Correlation** - Maps features to interpretable semantic concepts
- **Cross-Modal Understanding** - Leverages larger LMMs for feature interpretation
- **Automated Processing** - Scalable interpretation without manual annotation

## Feature Steering and Control

### Behavioral Control Capabilities

The learned features enable **precise model steering** by:

- **Selective Feature Activation** - Amplifying specific semantic features
- **Behavioral Modification** - Directing model attention and responses
- **Interpretable Control** - Understanding why specific outputs are generated
- **Fine-Grained Manipulation** - Precise control over model behavior

## Key Contributions
